* Real-time monitoring of low-frequency electromagnetic fields in substations, power-systems: A 2025 study describes a system for AC/DC magnetic field sensing (30 Hz-100 kHz) with six-axis sensors and wireless data transmission suitable for industrial deployment. ([MDPI][1])
* Use case: Detecting transformer leakage fields, grounding faults, harmonic disturbances in near real-time so operators can act quickly. ([MDPI][1])
* Transformers & electric machines: The principle of induced EMF underpins how generators/transformers work. ([resources.system-analysis.cadence.com][2])
* Why relevant in 2025: With growth of renewables, variable loads and harmonics, real-time EMF sensing is increasingly needed to maintain reliability, safety and compliance.

*Key takeaway*: EMF monitoring isn’t just theoretical – it’s being implemented in power/industrial environments for safety and diagnostics.

* Exposure concerns: A 2025 work focuses on minimising EMF exposure (from RF electromagnetic fields) in urban base station deployment while maintaining coverage: joint base-station placement and power optimisation. ([arXiv][3])
* Real-time/near-real-time estimation: Another 2025 study uses sensor-networks + neural networks to estimate realistic EMF exposure from RF sources in real-world settings. ([arXiv][4])
* Practical applications: Network operators can adjust transmit power / beam-forming / antenna placement to comply with guidelines, reduce unnecessary EMF exposure to public/workers.
* In 2025 this is especially important because of densification of wireless infrastructure (5G/6G) and public concern about RF exposure.

* Household appliances: Electric motors, induction cookers, bells – use electromagnetic induction. ([GeeksforGeeks][7])
* Wireless charging & RF devices: With more wireless chargers, IoT, sensors, the EMF environment around everyday devices changes.
* Apps & sensors: Example: “EMF Detector – Electromagnetic” app gives real-time readings of magnetic fields via phone sensors. ([Google Play][8])
* Public awareness: As people become more aware of electromagnetic exposure (e.g., via apps), consumer-level real-time EMF monitoring will grow.

* Real-time imaging of electromagnetic fields: One paper shows optically controlled plasma scattering technique to image EMF in real time. ([Optica Publishing Group][9])
* Millimetre-wave sensing: Using mmWave EM fields for motion/vital sign detection (e.g., human presence) is emerging. ([Wikipedia][10])
* Near-field electromagnetic ranging (NFER): Real-time location systems using near-field EM fields. ([Wikipedia][11])
* Why this matters in 2025: The frontier is moving beyond just “devices work by EMF” to “we monitor/control/visualise EMF in real time” for sensing, diagnostics, safety.



Summary & why this matters now

* The concept of EMF and electromagnetic induction isn’t just textbook — it underpins *many real-world applications*: power systems, communications, transport, medical devices, consumer electronics and emerging sensing technologies.
* In 2025, there’s a clear trend towards *real-time monitoring and control* of electromagnetic fields rather than only passive use: for safety, diagnostics, optimisation, exposure management.
* Regulatory/public awareness aspects are increasing (especially for RF EMF exposure), making real-time sensing and data analyses more important.
* Innovations in sensor networks, wireless transmission of EMF data, and data analytics (e.g., vector analysis of fields, AI estimation of exposure) are becoming practical.
* For designing systems (whether devices or infrastructure) one must consider the induced EMF, leakage fields, harmonics, interference, exposure — not just functionality.



If you like, I can *compile a table* of *“application domain → specific real-time EMF use case → technology & 2025-trend”*, which might help organise the information for study or reference. Would you like that?
